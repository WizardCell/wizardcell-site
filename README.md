# wizardcell.com Feedback & Bug Reporting
I've received numerous messages about bugs and errors on wizardcell.com, which I greatly appreciate! However, I often can't address them immediately, and by the time I can, I may have forgotten the details.

To streamline this process, I'll be using the Issues section of this repository to track bugs and updates. This way, I can keep a record of reported issues and mark them as resolved once fixed.

If you have any feedback, feel free to reach out via [X](https://x.com/wizardcells) or Discord. You are also welcome to create Issues directly in this repository.
